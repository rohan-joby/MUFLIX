## 🎯 About
Muflix is a catalogue of movies. The Web App will land on the homepage in which you can find a mix of movies belonging to different categories divided into rows.<br/>
When you can try to interact with the app, it redirects you to an authentication page, in which you can choose to sign up or to sign in: you can sign in with your custom account.<br/>
Each row represents a movie category, you can click on it and you will be redirected to the selected category once logged in. You can also navigate to the movies page or your favorites page.<br/> 
You can add/remove movies through the plus and minus buttons that you can find hovering each poster or the rectangle button on opening a single movie's detail page.
You have also the option to search through TMDB's catalogue using the search functionality inside the fixed navbar: you can search by movie name.<br/>
